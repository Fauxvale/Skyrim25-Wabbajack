The bare minimum to make vanilla Skyrim playable in 2025 as it should have been at launch in 2011.

# Introduction
Built as a spiritual successor to SME, Skyrim25 aims to be a clean base to build upon or just to play as-is. On it's own, it provides a near-identical-to-vanilla experience, but with less bugs and crashes *(hopefully)*. Each mod has been chosen to stay out of your way and make room for you to add your own, or just play the damn game if that's what you're looking for. 

## Features and Notable Mods
Skyrim25 provides two profiles: Special Edition and Anniversary Edition. Predictably, these control what Creation Club content is enabled, and their assorted patches. To change profiles, click the profiles dropdown above the left pane in MO2:

   - Undo Certain USSEP Changes & Vanilla Purity Patch on top
 - Unofficial Skyrim Modder's Patch - USMP SE
   - USMP includes a lot of popular bugfixes! Before adding additional fixes and patches, make sure to check if USMP already includes them!
 - (AE Profile Only) Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches (USCCCP)
 - Skyrim Misc Bugfix Compilation
 - Cleaned Skyrim SE/AE Textures
 - SkyUI
   - and it's assorted fixes
 - Unofficial High Definition Audio Project (UHDAP)

and many, many more!

### Optionals
Skyrim25 ships with a handful of optional mods you can choose to enable/disable as you see fit. These include:
 - SkyUI Vanilla Menus
 - Smaller Vanilla Cursors SE
 - NVIDIA Reflex Support
 - Modex - A Mod Explorer Menu (AddItemMenu)

They can all be individually enabled or disabled as you see fit by clicking the checkbox to the left of the mod name in MO2:
