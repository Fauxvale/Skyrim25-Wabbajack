Skyrim25 is Skyrim as Todd intended. The bare minimum to make vanilla Skyrim playable in 2025 as it should have been at launch in 2011.

# Introduction
Built as a spiritual successor to SME, Skyrim25 aims to be a clean base to build upon or just to play as-is. On it's own, it provides a near-identical-to-vanilla experience, but *(hopefully)* with less bugs and crashes. Each mod has been chosen to stay out of your way and make room for you to add your own, or just play the damn game if that's what you're looking for. 

## Features and Notable Mods
Skyrim25 provides two profiles: Special Edition and Anniversary Edition. Predictably, these control which Creation Club content is enabled, and their assorted patches. To change profiles, click the profiles dropdown above the left pane in MO2:
